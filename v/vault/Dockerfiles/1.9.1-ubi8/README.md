Building Vault

Docker build command: docker build --build-arg VAULT_VERSION=v1.9.1 -t vault .

Docker run command: docker run -d --name=dev-vault vault

Deploying vault on Openshift

```
$ oc new-project vault
--> Now using project "vault" on server "https://api-<cluster-address>:6443".
    You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:
    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example
    to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:
    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
--> clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:openshift:scc:anyuid added: "default"

#Login to podman as kubeadmin
podman login -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) --tls-verify=false $HOST

#Build Vault image from Dockerfile
podman build --build-arg VAULT_VERSION=v1.9.1 -t $HOST/local-images/vault:latest .

#Push the image as local image so that any project/namespace get the access.
podman push $HOST/openshift/vault:latest --tls-verify=false

$ oc describe is vault -n openshift

$ oc new-app image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/vault -e SKIP_CHOWN=true -e SKIP_SETCAP=true
