# Deploying Consul on Openshift
```
$ oc new-project consul
--> Now using project "consul" on server "https://api-<cluster-address>:6443".
    You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:
    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example
    to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:
    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname

$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default
--> clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/system:openshift:scc:anyuid added: "default"

# Get the default route host
export HOST=$(oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry --template='{{ .spec.host }}')

#Login to podman as kubeadmin
podman login -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) --tls-verify=false $HOST

#Build Consul image from Dockerfile
podman build --build-arg CONSUL_VERSION=v1.9.4 -t $HOST/local-images/consul:latest .

#Push the image as local image so that any project/namespace get the access.
podman push $HOST/openshift/consul:latest --tls-verify=false

$ oc describe is consul -n openshift

$ oc new-app image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/openshift/consul

    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/consul'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.

$ oc create route edge consule --service=consul --port=8500-tcp --insecure-policy=Redirect

// Access the Consul UI at route URL created in previous step
// Get URL from $ oc get all
