# Build CockroachDB v21.2.6-oss

Please find the instructions to build v21.2.6 release of CockroachDB and to execute the
community tests inside a UBI8 container below.

## UBI8 container

To run the container so that the build script and patches are available inside it, execute:

```
# docker container run -it -v `pwd`:/v21.2.6-oss --workdir /v21.2.6-oss --name ubi8_cockroach21.2.6-oss registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest /bin/bash
```

If you face any issue in accessing the contents of /v21.2.6-oss inside the container, please
try deleting the container and adding `--privileged=true` option to the run command.

Enable execute permissions for the build script and run it as:

```
# chmod +x cockroachdb_ubi8.sh
# ./cockroachdb_ubi8.sh
```

# Known issues

1. The tests in the following packages fail due to floating point precision issues (rounding off
differences) and floating point arithmetic differences between P and X. Zen does not use floating
point values and the community agreed that this does not affect functionality, so ignoring these
failures.

2. Tests in the following packages fail due to platform dependent filenames in the stack traces,
which has no functional impact. So, ignoring these failures.
