# Disclaimer       : This script has been tested in non-root mode on given
# ==========         platform using the mentioned version of the package.
#                    It may not work as expected with newer versions of the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Run the build-script in non-root mode with docker installed.
# 2. Travis check is set to false as script takes 2.5 hours to run.
# 3. Backward compatibility tests, tests that require Amazon-s3 credentials, tests that are flaky and in parity with intel are skipped.
# 4. Test for tasks server:test and server:internalClusterTest are failing in the test suite due to timeout errors, but pass when executed individually.These tasks take approximately 3-4 hours to complete, which is why they are being skipped.
